"""
The voice turn, end to end.

    mic PCM --ws--> [buffer] --> Groq Whisper --> ChatService --> sentence
    chunks --> ElevenLabs ws --> PCM --ws--> browser

Push-to-talk, so a turn is bounded by explicit start/end messages from the
client rather than by voice activity detection. That is what removes VAD,
echo cancellation and barge-in handling from this file entirely.

Frame types are self-describing: binary frames are always audio, text frames
are always JSON control messages, so no envelope or length prefix is needed.
