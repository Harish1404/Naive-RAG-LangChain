"""
Session lifecycle: establish, refresh, inspect, end.

The flow, end to end:

    1. The user signs in through Clerk on the frontend.
    2. The frontend sends that Clerk token once to POST /auth/session.
    3. We verify it, upsert the user and profile, and set two HttpOnly cookies.
    4. Every later request — including the WebSocket — carries those cookies
       automatically, and Clerk is not consulted again.

Tokens never appear in a response body. They are set as cookies the browser
sends but no script can read, which is the whole reason for doing it this way
rather than handing a JWT to localStorage.
